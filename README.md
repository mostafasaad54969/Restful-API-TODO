# Task Management API

A simple RESTful API for managing tasks using Express.js and SQLite. This API allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

## Features

- Create a new task
- Retrieve all tasks
- Update an existing task
- Delete a task

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- SQLite

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
````

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed. Run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Database**

   The SQLite database (`todo.db`) will be automatically created if it does not exist when the server starts. No manual setup is required.

## Usage

1. **Start the Server**

   Run the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   The server will start and listen on port `3000` (or another port specified in the environment variable `PORT`).

   - **Create a New Task**

     **Endpoint:** `POST /tasks`

     }
     ```

     **Response:**

     ```json
     {
       "id": 1,

       "completed": false
     }
     ```

   - **Retrieve All Tasks**

     **Endpoint:** `GET /tasks`

     **Response:**

     ```json
     [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "title": "Buy groceries",
         "description": "Get milk, eggs, and bread from the store.",
         "completed": false
       }
     ]
     ```

   - **Update a Task**

     **Endpoint:** `PUT /tasks/:id`

     **Request Body:**

     ```json
     {
       "title": "Buy groceries",
       "description": "Get milk, eggs, bread, and butter from the store.",
       "completed": true
     }
     ```

     **Response:**

     ```json
     {
       "id": 1,
       "title": "Buy groceries",
       "description": "Get milk, eggs, bread, and butter from the store.",
       "completed": true,
